# Nomenclature changes
- Greddiit => 4reddit
- Subgreddiit => Boardit

- Growth for stats is calculated as a function of the number of join requests sent to that particular Boardit
- Visits for a subreddit is calculated by the number of unique visitors who visit the Boardit in one day

# Like actual reddit, these features have been adopted:
- Usernames are unique
- Boardit names can not have spaces
- When you go to a Boardit page, by default you land on a new `Home` page where all posts in that Boardit can be seen

# Run the app
- Run `npm install` and `npm start` inside the `backend` and `frontend` directories to start frontend and backend

# Run using docker
- Run `docker-compose up --build` in the `4reddit` directory
