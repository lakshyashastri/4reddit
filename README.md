- Greddiit => 4reddit
- Subgreddiit => Boardit

- Growth for stats is calculated as a function of the number of join requests sent to that particular Boardit
- Visits is calculated by the number of unique visitors who visit the Boardit in one day

- # Like actual reddit, these features have been adopted:
- Usernames are unique
- Boardit names must not have spaces
- When you go to a Boardit page, by default you land on a new `Home` page where all posts in that Boardit can be seen

- Run `npm start` in both directories to start frontend and backend
